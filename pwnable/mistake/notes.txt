### MISTAKE ###

We all make mistakes, let's move on.
(don't take this too seriously, no fancy hacking skill is required at all)

This task is based on real event

hint : operator priority

ssh mistake@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The hint leads us to line 17:
    if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0){

Since < has higher precedens than =,
the file descripter is set to the result of:

open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0

This being 0 on success, means that fd is set to 0,
therefore it reads from STDIN

Now we just need to find two strings such that : s1 = (s2 xor 1)


mistake@ubuntu:~$ ./mistake
do not bruteforce...
AAAAAAAAAA
input password : @@@@@@@@@@
Password OK
Mommy, the operator priority always confuses me :(
