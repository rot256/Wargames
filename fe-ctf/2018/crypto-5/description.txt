bigsh0t has been sent something interesting, but it is encrypted. Luckily there is also a decryption program, but we are missing the key.

We did however manage to dump some of the memory while YYY was running the decryption program and managed to find part of the AES round keys. They are below (* means the nybble was unreadable) in hex.

Round 8:
*5*6da***f*54e***8*f83***c*c2f64
Round 9:
b*9399*f**46*7*458**54**944**b*3
Round 10:
*7b28*7d27*4**b9*f****9e**d87**d
