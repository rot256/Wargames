We have captured a spy. They were carrying this device with them. It seems to be some kind of Z80-based processor connected to an antenna for wireless communications. We also managed to record the last message they sent but unfortunately it seems to be encrypted. According to our research it seems like the device has an AES hardware peripheral for more efficient encryption. You need to help us recover the message. We have extracted the firmware running on the device and you can also program the device with your own firmware to figure out how it works. I heard that a security researcher at ACME Corporation found some bugs in the hardware but we haven't managed to get hold of them for details and we need this solved now! Good luck!
