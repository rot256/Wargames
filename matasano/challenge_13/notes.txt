The oracle creates a valid "session-cookie-like" string
and encrypts it using ECB

It will only create cookies of the form

email=xxx&uid=10&role=user

Our goal is to create a cookie for, role=admin
This is done by stitching such a cookie together from multiple other cookies,
which individually follow the above format but mixed allows us to create a
role=admin session.

We start by creating a cookie for

email=xxx&uid=10&role=|user

Where | indicates that we wish to have a block "split" here.
We simply manipulate the email length to make this the case - easy.

We now create a cookie for:

email=yyy|admin&uid=10&role=user

Again by mainpulating the email length (not much else we can do)

We now stitch this together into

email=xxx&uid=10&role=admin&uid=10&role=user

But! The last variable will override the first! We counter this by removing
the last block, leaving us with

email=yyy&uid=10&role=admin&uid=10&rol

But this will fail to decode, since the last key is not followed by a value,
luckly we can juse the first part of the second cookie we created:

email=yyy

And append this to get:

email=xxx&uid=10&role=admin&uid=10&rolemail=yyy

This key is just ignored by the server, lastly we generate a valid padding
block, this can be done in two ways, by making the server encrypt a block with
padding specifically or making sure the server generates a full block of
padding (by making the plaintext a multiple of 16).

And we win!
